# SPREADINATOR

  - An opinionated personal utility to randomly spread source files into a number of destination directories where I will step through them and keep the good, ditch the bad.
  - I also use it to even up some daily data to be archived.
  - Todo:
    1. Redistribute any tree with my typical numbered directories to spread between.
    2. Spread/respread by size.
    3. Spread/respread by file count.
    4. Spread/respread with best match for size and count.
    5. Disable random command line argument.
    6. Kill metadata.
    7. Imagemagick integration.
      1. resize up and/or down to fit a window.
      2. Convert single frame to any other single frame format supported.
      3. Convert multiple frame to another multiple frame format or possibly videos.
      4. Combine numbered images into a multi frame image.
      5. Split multiple frame (gif, tiff, apng) image into source frames as single image files.
    8. Identify files by magic numbers and rename possibly.
    9.
